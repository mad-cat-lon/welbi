# Challenge 6: DevOps & CI/CD Pipeline

**Difficulty**: Medium-Hard | **Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours | **Focus**: DevOps & Deployment

## Context

The development team needs a robust CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality, run tests, and deploy the application safely. Currently, there's no automated testing, building, or deployment process. You need to implement a complete GitHub Actions workflow that handles the entire development lifecycle.

## Current State

- No CI/CD pipeline in place
- Manual testing and building process
- No automated deployment
- No quality gates or checks
- Rush monorepo setup exists but not integrated with CI
- No environment management strategy

## Your Task

Design and implement a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline that:
1. **Automated Testing**: Run all tests on every PR and push
2. **Quality Gates**: Enforce code quality and security checks
3. **Build Pipeline**: Build all packages efficiently
4. **Deployment Strategy**: Deploy to staging and production environments
5. **Monitoring**: Add deployment monitoring and rollback capabilities

## Requirements

### CI/CD Pipeline Requirements

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow Structure**
   ```yaml
   # Example structure
   name: CI/CD Pipeline
   on:
     push:
       branches: [main, develop]
     pull_request:
       branches: [main]
   
   jobs:
     test:
       # Testing jobs
     build:
       # Build jobs  
     deploy-staging:
       # Staging deployment
     deploy-production:
       # Production deployment
   ```

2. **Multi-stage Pipeline**
   - **Lint & Format**: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript checks
   - **Test**: Unit tests, integration tests, e2e tests
   - **Security**: Dependency scanning, security linting
   - **Build**: Build all packages with Rush
   - **Deploy**: Deploy to staging and production

3. **Rush Integration**
   - Leverage Rush's incremental build capabilities
   - Use Rush's dependency management in CI
   - Implement efficient caching strategies
   - Handle monorepo complexity properly

### Quality Gates & Checks

1. **Code Quality**
   - ESLint with security rules
   - TypeScript strict mode compliance
   - Code coverage thresholds (80%+ for critical paths)
   - Bundle size limits and performance budgets

2. **Security Scanning**
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Secret detection in code
   - Container image scanning (if using Docker)
   - SAST (Static Application Security Testing)

3. **Performance Checks**
   - Lighthouse CI for frontend performance
   - Bundle size analysis and limits
   - API response time benchmarks
   - Database query performance checks

### Build & Deployment Strategy

1. **Environment Management**
   ```yaml
   environments:
     staging:
       url: https://staging.welbi.app
       requirements:
         - test
         - security-scan
     production:
       url: https://welbi.app
       requirements:
         - staging-deployment
         - manual-approval
   ```

2. **Docker Implementation**
   - Multi-stage Docker builds
   - Optimize image sizes
   - Security scanning of images
   - Registry management

3. **Infrastructure as Code**
   - Define deployment infrastructure
   - Environment configuration management
   - Secret management strategy
   - Database migration handling

4. **Deployment Strategies**
   - Blue-green deployments
   - Rolling updates with health checks
   - Rollback capabilities
   - Feature flags integration

### Monitoring & Observability

1. **Deployment Monitoring**
   - Health checks post-deployment
   - Application performance monitoring
   - Error rate monitoring
   - User experience metrics

2. **Alerting & Notifications**
   - Slack/Discord notifications for deployments
   - Email alerts for failures
   - Dashboard for deployment status
   - Rollback triggers and automation

3. **Logging & Metrics**
   - Centralized logging strategy
   - Metrics collection and visualization
   - Performance monitoring
   - Security event logging

## Advanced Requirements

1. **Branch Protection & Policies**
   - Require PR reviews
   - Require status checks to pass
   - Require branches to be up to date
   - Dismiss stale reviews

2. **Release Management**
   - Semantic versioning strategy
   - Automated changelog generation
   - Release notes automation
   - Tag-based deployments

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Cache dependencies and build artifacts
   - Parallel job execution
   - Conditional workflows
   - Efficient Docker layer caching

## Deliverables

1. **Complete CI/CD Pipeline**
   - GitHub Actions workflows for all stages
   - Quality gates and security checks implemented
   - Build and deployment automation working
   - Monitoring and alerting configured

2. **Infrastructure Documentation**
   - Deployment architecture diagram
   - Environment setup instructions
   - Rollback procedures
   - Troubleshooting guide

3. **Developer Guidelines**
   - Git workflow and branching strategy
   - PR requirements and review process
   - Deployment procedures
   - Emergency response procedures

4. **Performance Metrics**
   - Pipeline execution times
   - Build success rates
   - Deployment frequency metrics
   - Mean time to recovery (MTTR)

## Getting Started

1. Analyze the existing Rush configuration
2. Set up GitHub Actions workflow files
3. Configure quality gates and security checks
4. Implement build and test automation
5. Set up staging and production environments
6. Configure monitoring and alerting
