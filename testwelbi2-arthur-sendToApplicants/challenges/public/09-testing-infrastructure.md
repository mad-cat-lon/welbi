# Challenge 9: Testing Infrastructure

**Difficulty**: Medium-Hard | **Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours | **Focus**: Testing Strategy & Infrastructure

## Context

The codebase currently lacks a comprehensive testing strategy. There are no unit tests, integration tests, or performance tests. The team needs a robust testing infrastructure that can ensure code quality, catch regressions, and validate performance.

## Current State

- No existing test suite or testing framework
- No test automation in CI/CD pipeline
- No performance testing or benchmarking
- No test coverage measurement
- Manual testing only for quality assurance

## Your Task

Design and implement a comprehensive testing infrastructure that includes:
1. Unit Testing Framework for components and functions
2. Integration Testing for API endpoints and workflows
3. End-to-End Testing for complete user journeys
4. Performance Testing and benchmarking
5. CI Integration for automated testing

## Requirements

### Testing Framework Setup

1. **Choose Testing Tools**
   - Select appropriate frameworks (Jest, Vitest, Playwright)
   - Configure for monorepo structure
   - Set up mocking utilities
   - Implement test data factories

2. **Test Organization**
   - Establish directory structure
   - Create naming conventions
   - Implement shared utilities
   - Configure per-package testing

### Unit Testing Implementation

1. **Frontend Component Testing**
   - Test React components with testing library
   - Test user interactions and state changes
   - Test error boundaries and edge cases
   - Mock external dependencies

2. **Backend Logic Testing**
   - Test GraphQL resolvers
   - Test business logic functions
   - Test database operations
   - Test permission validation

3. **Utility Testing**
   - Test date/time utilities
   - Test mathematical functions
   - Test validation logic
   - Test error handling

### Integration & E2E Testing

1. **API Integration Testing**
   - Test GraphQL endpoints
   - Test authentication flows
   - Test database transactions
   - Test error scenarios

2. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Test complete user workflows
   - Test cross-browser compatibility
   - Test responsive design
   - Test accessibility features

### Performance Testing

1. **Load Testing**
   - Test API under load
   - Test database performance
   - Test concurrent user scenarios
   - Monitor response times

2. **Frontend Performance**
   - Test Core Web Vitals
   - Monitor bundle sizes
   - Test rendering performance
   - Detect memory leaks

### CI/CD Integration

1. **Automated Testing**
   - Run tests on every PR
   - Generate coverage reports
   - Fail builds on test failures
   - Track performance regressions

## Deliverables

1. Complete testing framework with unit, integration, and E2E tests
2. Performance testing infrastructure and baselines
3. CI/CD integration with automated test execution
4. Testing documentation and guidelines

## Success Criteria

- 80%+ code coverage across packages
- Load testing supports 100+ concurrent users
- All tests run automatically in CI
- Test suite completes in under 10 minutes
